# big-data
This repo is for my class big data
# Current:
I am currently a senior and I will be graduate by the end of this semester. I am working on my Computer Science: General Emphasis degree with minor in Mathematics.   

# Background:
I am from Nepal, just a small and beautiful country with the Himalayas. During my free time, I like to watch and play football(soccer) and just hang out with friends and family.

# Plans
After graduation, I am planning to work full time for some experience but due to this pandemic, I am not sure I will be able to do that. So my next plan will be to join the master's program.  I am hoping for full-stack developer or go to the data science field but I will welcome all the opportunities that will come in my place.
